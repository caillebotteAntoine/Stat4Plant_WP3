	abstract = {To two Fellows of the Society, John Graunt (elected 1663) and Edmond Halley (elected 1678), the world owes the invention of that powerful vital-statistical instrument, the life table or table of mortality, but the respective shares of these men in the discovery is a matter of dispute. In the first edition of Graunt’s famous ‘Natural and Political Observations mentioned in a following Index and made upon the Bills of Mortality' (p. 84 of fifth edition), which secured his admission to the Society, Graunt included a short table purporting to give the survivors of 100 quick conceptions at the end of 6, 16, 26, 36, 46, 56, 66, 76 and 86 years. The Bills of Mortality in Graunt’s time did not record ages at death, and he reached the second entry in his table, viz. 64 survivors at the age of 6, by a rough classification of the named causes of death into those which wholly affected children (thrush, convulsion, rickets, etc.), and those of which he thought about half (small pox, swine pox, etc.) affected children below the age of 6. The remaining figures are conjectural. Some statisticians hold that Graunt had discovered the principle that, under certain conditions, a survivorship table could be computed from a summation of deaths in age groups; others believe that the table is a mere guess and not even Graunt’s but a contribution to his book from his friend William Petty. There is no doubt that, as an instrument of computation, the table is of little value.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Genomic selection - the prediction of breeding values using DNA polymorphisms - is a disruptive method that has widely been adopted by animal and plant breeders to increase productivity. It was recently shown that other sources of molecular variations such as those resulting from transcripts or metabolites could be used to accurately predict complex traits. These endophenotypes have the advantage of capturing the expressed genotypes and consequently the complex regulatory networks that occur in the different layers between the genome and the phenotype. However, obtaining such omics data at very large scales, such as those typically experienced in breeding, remains challenging. As an alternative, we proposed using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) as a high-throughput, low cost and non-destructive tool to indirectly capture endophenotypic variants and compute relationship matrices for predicting complex traits, and coined this new approach ”phenomic selection” (PS). We tested PS on two species of economic interest (Triticum aestivum L. and Populus nigra L.) using NIRS on various tissues (grains, leaves, wood). We showed that one could reach predictions as accurate as with molecular markers, for developmental, tolerance and productivity traits, even in environments radically different from the one in which NIRS were collected. Our work constitutes a proof of concept and provides new perspectives for the breeding community, as PS is theoretically applicable to any organism at low cost and does not require any molecular information.},

This article offers a partial solution to this problem. The authors treat cohort effects as random effects and age and period effects as fixed effects in a mixed model. Using this approach, they can (1) assess the amount of variance in the dependent variable that is associated with cohorts while controlling for the age and period dummy variables, (2) model the dependencies that result from the age-period-specific rates for a single cohort being observed multiple times, and (3) assess how much of the variance in observations that is associated with cohorts is explained by differences in the characteristics of cohorts. The authors use empirical data to see how their results compare with other analyses in the literature.},

	abstract = {We present an approach of Linear Mixed Effects Modelling to analyse the influence of crop management factors like rotation, tillage, seeding time and cultivar on pesticide use intensity from on-farm data. We use data from 761 winter wheat crops in eight commercial farms and six different regions of Eastern Germany. By defining cropping year, farm and region as random effects, the variability caused by these external factors can be accounted for before estimating effects of crop management factors. The objective of the research we present was to develop and test a method to analyse pesticide use monitoring data appropriately in order to (1) gain insight into the relationship between crop management and pesticide use, (2) integrate external sources of variability into the analysis and quantify their effect, and thereby (3) make a large data pool accessible for further interpretation which will develop further because this kind of monitoring has recently been made mandatory throughout Europe. The benefit of such an analysis is to utilise the practical experience generated by farmers with their daily work that is mirrored in these data for research purposes. This could be valuable in, for example, assessing the effect of Integrated Pest Management (IPM) measures on the pesticide use intensity in arable agriculture, for which evidence is still scarce. We quantified pesticide use intensity using the Standardised Treatment Index (STI). For fungicides, herbicides and growth regulators, we modelled the STI as response of 11 management variables using Linear Mixed Effects Modelling. Insecticide use intensity was not modelled since most fields were not treated with insecticides. Our results confirmed that pesticide use variability is mainly caused by external sources, but pesticide use intensity is significantly connected to crop management, mainly to preceding crop, seeding time and cultivar characteristics. Pesticide use was smaller when preventive measures typical for IPM were applied. We show that the Linear Mixed Effects Modelling approach with multiple predictor variables is well suited for analysing the connection between crop management and pesticide use. We discuss how the random variables influence pesticide use and treatment decisions. Our findings imply that future pesticide use analysis must take regional and farm specific factors into account more strongly, especially when deriving statistical means from on-farm samples. We conclude that the pesticide use monitoring could serve as a valuable data base for scientific research on IPM when data acquisition and analysis are well exploited. Results may be useful for convincing farmers to adopt cropping systems which are less dependent on pesticide use.},

To deal with these problems, a novel method is introduced, the stochastic approximation EM (SAEM), which replaces the expectation step of the EM algorithm by one iteration of a stochastic approximation procedure. The convergence of the SAEM algorithm is established under conditions that are applicable to many practical situations. Moreover, it is proved that, under mild additional conditions, the attractive stationary points of the SAEM algorithm correspond to the local maxima of the function. presented to support our findings.},
